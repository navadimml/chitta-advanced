# === Developmental Timeline (SKELETON - Future Feature) ===

@dataclass
class DevelopmentalMilestone:
    """
    SKELETON - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

    A significant developmental event in the child's life.

    This is the foundation for a proper developmental timeline feature.
    Unlike system events (when we analyzed a video), these are real-world
    developmental moments that matter to parents and clinicians.

    FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
    - Belongs in the child's Understanding (part of Gestalt state)
    - Should be displayed in ChildSpace - either in "מה גילינו" tab
      transformed into a developmental timeline, or as a dedicated view
    - Extraction: LLM tool during conversation when parent mentions milestones
    - Display: Age-based timeline (not date-based) showing child's journey

    Examples:
    - "First words at 12 months"
    - "Started walking at 14 months"
    - "Regression in speech at 2 years"
    - "Started OT therapy at 3 years"
    - "Toilet trained at 3.5 years"

    Required for implementation:
    1. Add `developmental_milestones: List[DevelopmentalMilestone]` to Gestalt
    2. Create LLM tool: `record_milestone` for extraction during conversation
    3. Update ChildSpace UI to display age-based timeline
    4. Consider: auto-extraction from existing facts that have temporal info
