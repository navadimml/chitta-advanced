# The Living Gestalt

## What This Document Is

This document captures our understanding of what the Gestalt truly is, how it's built, and how the conversation process creates understanding. It's the philosophical and architectural foundation for Chitta's core purpose: **seeing the whole child**.

---

## Part 1: The Fundamental Shift

### From Problem-Focused to Child-First

Traditional child development apps ask:
> "What's wrong? What are you worried about?"

This frames the child through their difficulty. The child becomes their problem.

**Chitta asks differently:**
> "Tell me about your child. What are they like? What do they love?"

The concern still comes. But now it lands in context—one aspect of a whole person, not the defining frame.

### Why This Matters

Daniel is not "speech delay." Daniel is:
- A careful observer who processes internally
- Loves dinosaurs and creates elaborate scenarios
- Connects deeply with few people
- Laughs at physical comedy
- Happens to also have speech emerging slowly

If we start with the problem, we might never learn about the dinosaurs. And the dinosaurs might be the key—the gateway to connection, the window into his rich imagination, the proof that his mind is full even when his words are few.

**The difficulty is real. But it's not the whole child.**

---

## Part 2: What Is the Living Gestalt?

### Not a Data Structure

The Gestalt is not:
- A collection of fields
- A completeness score
- A checklist of gathered information
- A static snapshot

### A Living Understanding

The Gestalt IS:
- A continuously evolving picture of who this child is
- Hypotheses being formed, tested, refined
- Patterns emerging from scattered observations
- Contradictions held with curiosity
- Open questions driving exploration
- The essence of the child becoming clearer over time

### The Seven Components

```
THE LIVING GESTALT

1. ESSENCE
   Who is this child?
   ├── Core qualities (not deficits—character)
   ├── Temperament (how they are in the world)
   ├── Energy pattern (intensity, pace, rhythm)
   └── What makes them them

2. STRENGTHS
   What do they do well?
   ├── Abilities and capabilities
   ├── Interests and passions
   ├── What lights them up
   └── What surprises people about them

3. DEVELOPMENTAL PICTURE
   The complete landscape
   ├── All domains, not just concerns
   ├── Where they shine
   ├── Where they struggle
   └── How it all connects

4. CONTEXT
   The world around them
   ├── Family structure and dynamics
   ├── History (birth, development, medical)
   ├── Previous evaluations/diagnoses
   ├── Educational setting
   └── Daily life

5. CONCERNS
   What brought them here
   ├── In context of everything above
   ├── Not the defining frame
   └── One part of the picture

6. PATTERNS
   What connects
   ├── Themes across observations
   ├── Connections across domains
   └── Threads through time

7. HYPOTHESES & QUESTIONS
   The living edge
   ├── Working theories (held lightly)
   ├── Open questions (honest uncertainty)
   └── What we want to explore
```

---

## Part 3: The Complete Developmental Landscape

### Why Completeness Matters

Without a complete map, we miss connections:

**Birth history → Current challenges**
> "He was premature, 32 weeks"

This changes everything about developmental expectations.

**Family history → Pattern recognition**
> "My husband was a late talker too"

This suggests familial pattern, changes prognosis.

**Previous diagnosis → Already known**
> "The neurologist said possible ADHD"

We don't need to discover this—it's already suspected.

**Sibling dynamics → Context for behavior**
> "His older sister speaks for him"

Speech delay might be partly environmental.

## Part 4: Two Types of Knowledge

### Domain Knowledge (Universal)

This is clinical/developmental knowledge that exists before we meet any specific child:

- "Children with attention difficulties often also have sensory processing differences"
- "Speech delays can be expressive, receptive, or pragmatic—different causes, different paths"
- "Slow-to-warm is a temperament type, not a disorder"
- "Difficulty with transitions can indicate anxiety, sensory issues, or need for predictability"

The LLM already has this knowledge. We don't teach it—we **focus** it.

### Child-Specific Knowledge (The Gestalt)

This is what we learn about THIS particular child:

- "Daniel needs time to observe before engaging"
- "He connects through music"
- "Pressure makes him shut down, patience opens him up"

This starts at zero and grows through conversation.

### How They Interact

**Early in conversation:** Domain knowledge generates exploration paths
> Parent mentions attention concerns.
> Domain knowledge activates: "Check sensory, emotional regulation, motor planning..."

**As understanding builds:** Child-specific knowledge guides curiosity
> We've learned Daniel is "slow to warm" across contexts.
> Now we wonder: "What conditions help him warm up faster?"

The transition happens naturally as the Gestalt forms.

---

## Part 5: Hypothesis-Driven Exploration

### What Is a Hypothesis?

A hypothesis is a **working theory**—something we think might be true, held lightly, open to revision.

Not: "Daniel has autism"
But: "Daniel's speech delay might be primarily temperament-related—he has the capacity but needs safety to show it"

### Where Hypotheses Come From

**From domain knowledge:**
> Parent mentions speech delay.
> Clinical knowledge generates: "Could be expressive only, could be receptive too, could be pragmatic, could be context-dependent..."

**From patterns:**
> Parent mentions morning struggles, car seat resistance, bedtime battles.
> Pattern emerges: "Transitions seem hard across contexts"

**From contradictions:**
> Daniel usually withdraws with new people, but grandmother says he's spontaneous with her.
> Question forms: "What's different about grandmother?"

### How Hypotheses Drive Exploration

Hypotheses create **curiosity**—a desire to understand more.

Without hypothesis: "Tell me more about speech"
With hypothesis: "You said more words come out when you're alone and relaxed. What happens in his body when your mother asks him to perform? Does he tense up? Look away?"

The hypothesis ("performance anxiety might be involved") shapes the question.

### The Hypothesis Lifecycle

```
1. EMERGENCE
   Pattern detected or domain knowledge activated
   "I'm noticing that..."

2. FORMATION
   Working theory crystallizes
   "It seems like..."

3. EXPLORATION
   Curiosity drives questions
   "I wonder if... Let me ask about..."

4. TESTING
   Evidence confirms, refutes, or complicates
   "That fits" / "That's surprising" / "It's more complex"

5. EVOLUTION
   Hypothesis refines or transforms
   "Actually, it might be more about..."

6. RESOLUTION (sometimes)
   Becomes insight or generates new questions
   "Now I understand..." / "But now I'm curious about..."
```

---

## Part 6: Pattern Recognition

### What Is a Pattern?

A pattern is a **theme that appears across observations**—a thread connecting scattered data points.

**Scattered observations:**
- "Mornings are hard"
- "He hates the car seat"
- "Bedtime is a battle"
- "Leaving the playground was a disaster"

**Pattern:** Transitions are difficult

### How Patterns Emerge

Patterns emerge when we notice:
- Same theme in different contexts
- Similar reactions to different triggers
- Recurring words or concerns from parent

The LLM naturally does this. We remind it to **attend** to patterns:
> "As you listen, notice if themes connect across what the parent shares"

### Patterns Within First Session

Pattern recognition isn't just across sessions. It happens within a single conversation:

```
Turn 3: "He goes silent when asked to perform"
Turn 7: "He watches for 20 minutes before joining at playground"
Turn 12: "He hides behind me with new people"

Pattern forming: Approach caution across contexts
Hypothesis: This is temperament (slow-to-warm), not inability
```

### From Pattern to Hypothesis

Patterns are observations. Hypotheses are theories about what patterns mean.

**Pattern:** Transitions are hard
**Hypotheses:**
- Could be sensory (transitions involve sensory shifts)
- Could be anxiety (uncertainty about what's next)
- Could be need for control (doesn't like things imposed)
- Could be all three interacting

The pattern is certain (we observed it). The hypothesis is uncertain (we're exploring meaning).

---

## Part 7: The Conversation Flow

### The Sequence Matters

```
PHASE 1: MEETING THE CHILD (Essence & Strengths)

"Tell me about [child]. What are they like?"
"What do they love? What makes them light up?"
"What are they good at? What surprises you about them?"
"How would you describe their personality?"

Purpose: See the child as a person first.
         Strengths provide context and intervention pathways.
         Trust builds when parent feels their child is seen.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 2: THE CONTEXT (Family & History)

"Tell me about your family. Who's at home?"
"How was the pregnancy and birth?"
"How was early development?"
"Has [child] been evaluated or diagnosed before?"
"Any therapy or interventions? What helped?"

Purpose: Complete the picture.
         History explains present.
         Don't miss birth complications, family patterns, previous diagnoses.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 3: THE CONCERN (Now In Context)

"And what brought you to us today?"
"Tell me more about that..."
"When did you first notice?"
"What does it look like when it happens?"

Purpose: Now the concern lands in context.
         It's one part of a whole child.
         Domain knowledge activates exploration paths.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 4: DEEPER EXPLORATION (Hypothesis-Driven)

"I'm noticing a pattern... does that fit?"
"Given what you've shared, I'm curious about..."
"Can you tell me about a specific time when...?"
"What happens in [related domain]?"

Purpose: Hypotheses drive questions.
         Stories illuminate what summaries cannot.
         Patterns connect across observations.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PHASE 5: EMERGING UNDERSTANDING (Synthesis)

"From everything you've shared, here's what I'm seeing..."
"Does this picture feel right to you?"
"I'm still wondering about..."

Purpose: Share emerging gestalt with parent.
         Check: Does it resonate?
         Name open questions honestly.
```

### Why Strengths First?

Starting with strengths isn't just nice. It's clinically essential:

**1. Builds trust**
Parent feels seen, not judged.

**2. Reveals capacity**
What child CAN do tells us about underlying capability.

**3. Provides intervention pathways**
Strengths are how we reach the child. Daniel connects through music → music-based therapy.

**4. Contextualizes difficulty**
Difficulty in a capable child means something different than same difficulty with global delays.

**5. It's honest**
Every child has strengths. To ignore them is to see only part of truth.

---

## Part 8: Focusing the LLM

### The Principle

The LLM has vast clinical knowledge:
- DSM-5 criteria
- Developmental milestones
- Comorbidity patterns
- Temperament frameworks
- Differential diagnosis

We don't teach it. We **focus** it.

### What We Provide

**1. Structure** (what to build)
> "You are building a Living Gestalt with these components: Essence, Strengths, Full Picture, Concerns, Patterns, Hypotheses, Open Questions"

**2. Sequence** (what order)
> "Start with the child, not the problem. Strengths first. Concerns in context."

**3. Completeness reminder** (what not to miss)
> "Always explore: birth history, family patterns, previous diagnoses, what's been tried"

**4. Process** (how to explore)
> "Let domain knowledge generate exploration paths. Notice patterns. Form hypotheses. Let curiosity drive questions."

**5. Output awareness** (what to track)
> "As you learn, notice: emerging patterns, forming hypotheses, confirmations, contradictions, open questions"

### What We Don't Provide

We don't say:
- "If ADHD, check sensory" (it knows this)
- "Speech delay has three subtypes" (it knows this)
- "Slow-to-warm is a temperament type" (it knows this)

We say:
- "Apply your clinical knowledge to generate exploration paths"
- "You know what domains typically connect—follow those threads"

**Structure without content. Focus without constraint.**

### The Microscope Analogy

A scientist knows biology. The microscope doesn't teach biology—it focuses attention on what's actually there.

We're building a microscope for understanding children:
- The lens (framework) focuses attention
- The scientist (LLM) interprets what it sees
- The specimen (child/family) reveals itself

---

## Part 9: The First Session

### The Paradox

In the first session, we have no knowledge of this specific child. Yet we need to:
- Build understanding purposefully
- Guide conversation toward completeness
- Know what to explore

How can we be hypothesis-driven with no hypotheses yet?

### The Resolution

**Early:** Domain knowledge drives exploration
> Parent mentions speech concern.
> Clinical knowledge activates: "What type? What context? What co-occurs?"

**Middle:** Patterns begin forming
> Multiple observations connect.
> "I'm noticing transitions come up repeatedly..."

**Late:** Child-specific hypotheses emerge
> Working theory crystallizes.
> "It seems like Daniel is a slow-to-warm child who needs safety first..."

The transition happens naturally within the first conversation.

### By End of First Session

We should have:
- Sense of who this child is (emerging essence)
- Knowledge of their strengths and interests
- Understanding of family and history context
- Clear picture of the concern
- Maybe a pattern or two
- Working hypotheses (even tentative)
- Open questions we're curious about

Not complete. Not confident. But **forming**.

---

## Part 10: The Living Edge

### What Keeps the Gestalt Alive

The Gestalt is never "done." It stays alive through:

**Hypotheses** - Working theories that drive curiosity
**Open Questions** - What we're still wondering
**Contradictions** - What doesn't fit yet
**New Information** - Each conversation adds

### Honest Uncertainty

The Gestalt holds uncertainty explicitly:

```
WORKING HYPOTHESIS:
Daniel's speech delay exists in context of slow-to-warm temperament.
Capacity is there; safety is the key.

CONTRADICTIONS:
- Usually cautious, but grandmother says he's spontaneous with her
- What's different about that relationship?

OPEN QUESTIONS:
- Is there also an underlying language processing issue?
- Or is it purely temperament/context?
- What would we see if he felt completely safe?

CONFIDENCE:
- Essence: Forming (0.6)
- Concern understanding: Good (0.75)
- Full picture: Partial (0.5)
```

### Evolution Over Time

```
Week 2: Initial gestalt forms
"Sensitive child, speech emerging slowly, seems cautious"

Week 4: Gestalt solidifies
"Careful observer who connects through sensory pathways.
Speech is intentional, not struggling. Needs safety."

Week 8: Gestalt deepens
"Daniel is a deeply feeling child who experiences the world
intensely. His speech delay is real but exists within high
sensitivity and careful processing. Not deficit—different
timeline. Thrives with patience and gentle approach."

Week 12: New dimension emerges
"The grandmother relationship reveals something. When he
feels truly accepted without expectation, he's actually
spontaneous. The 'slow to warm' might be response to
perceived evaluation, not inherent pace."
```

---

## Summary: The Living Gestalt

### What It Is

A continuously evolving, hypothesis-driven understanding of a whole child—their essence, strengths, context, and concerns—built through purposeful conversation and held with honest uncertainty.

### How It's Built

1. Start with the child, not the problem
2. See strengths first—they're the key to everything
3. Complete the picture—history, family, context
4. Let concerns land in context
5. Notice patterns as they connect
6. Form hypotheses, hold them lightly
7. Let curiosity drive exploration
8. Track what's uncertain and contradictory

### The Role of the LLM

The LLM has clinical knowledge. We provide:
- Focus (what to attend to)
- Structure (how to organize)
- Sequence (strengths first, concerns in context)
- Completeness (what not to miss)

We don't fill in details. We shape the container. The conversation fills it.

### The Goal

When a parent engages with Chitta, they should gain something rare:

**A clear, complete picture of who their child is—not just what's difficult, but who they are as a whole person—and how to help them thrive.**

The Gestalt IS the product. Everything else exists to build it.

---

## Part 11: Conversation Dynamics

### Chitta Initiates

Chitta is not a passive chatbot waiting for input. Chitta **opens** the conversation, **guides** the exploration, and **maintains** the thread across sessions.

The parent responds to Chitta. Chitta sets the frame.

### First Meeting Opening

The opening must get essentials first, then move to strengths:

```
Chitta: "שלום! אני צ'יטה, ואני כאן כדי לעזור לך להבין
        את הילד/ה שלך טוב יותר.

        קודם כל - מה השם ובן/בת כמה?"

        "Hi! I'm Chitta, and I'm here to help you
        understand your child better.

        First - what's their name and how old are they?"
```

After essentials (name, age, gender):

```
Chitta: "דניאל, בן 3.5.

        ספרי לי עליו - מה הוא אוהב? מה מאיר לו את העיניים?"

        "Daniel, 3.5.

        Tell me about him - what does he love?
        What lights him up?"
```

**Age is foundational.** Every observation is interpreted through developmental expectations for that age. Without age, we can't understand anything.

### Parent Can Say Anything

After Chitta opens, the parent might:
- Answer directly
- Pivot to their concern
- Share a story
- Express emotion
- Ask a question

All are valid. Chitta receives what they bring, then bridges back toward building understanding.

### The Bridging Skill

When parent pivots to concern before we've built the foundation:

```
Parent: "Daniel, he's 3.5, and I'm really worried about his speech."

Chitta DOESN'T say: "Let's talk about speech."
         (Following too quickly, missing the foundation)

Chitta DOESN'T say: "We'll get to that. First tell me what he loves."
         (Dismissive, ignores what they brought)

Chitta DOES say: "דניאל, בן 3.5, ואת מודאגת מהדיבור שלו.
                 אני שומעת. נגיע לזה.

                 קודם, עזרי לי להכיר אותו - מה הוא כן אוהב?
                 מה מעניין אותו?"

                 "Daniel, 3.5, and you're worried about his speech.
                 I hear you. We'll get there.

                 First, help me know him - what does he love?
                 What interests him?"
```

**Acknowledge → Promise to return → Bridge to what's needed**

### When Parent Shares a Story

Stories are gold. Don't interrupt. Don't redirect. Receive fully.

```
Parent: "Daniel, 3.5. Actually, something happened yesterday -
        he was lining up his cars like always, and my mom
        came over. Usually he ignores her for an hour. But
        she started humming, and he looked up at her. Really
        looked. Then he brought her his favorite car."

Chitta: "וואו. הרגע הזה חשוב.

        הוא שמע את הזמזום, הרים את המבט, באמת הסתכל עליה,
        ואז יזם - הביא לה את האוטו האהוב עליו.
        זה חיבור. זו יוזמה. זה שיתוף.

        המוזיקה פתחה משהו.

        זה אומר לי הרבה על מי שדניאל הוא.
        ספרי לי עוד עליו - מה הוא אוהב מלבד האוטואים?"

        "Wow. That moment matters.

        He heard the humming, looked up, really looked at her,
        and then initiated - brought her his favorite car.
        That's connection. That's initiative. That's sharing.

        The music opened something.

        This tells me a lot about who Daniel is.
        Tell me more about him - what does he love besides the cars?"
```

**Receive the story fully → Reflect what it reveals → Save it → Bridge forward**

### Completeness Awareness

Chitta always knows what's missing in the background:

```
GESTALT CHECK (running continuously)

ESSENTIALS
├── Name: ✓ Daniel
├── Age: ✓ 3.5
└── Gender: ✓ Male

STRENGTHS/ESSENCE
├── Interests: partial (cars)
├── What he loves: ?
├── Personality: emerging (careful, takes time)
└── Strengths: partial (can connect, initiates)

HISTORY
├── Pregnancy/birth: ?
├── Milestones: ?
├── Previous evaluations: ?
└── Interventions: ?

FAMILY
├── Structure: partial (grandmother mentioned)
├── Siblings: ?
├── Who at home: ?
└── Family history: ?

CONCERNS
├── Main concern: speech (mentioned but not explored)
└── Details: ?

NEXT PRIORITY:
Build more strengths/essence, then get history,
then explore speech concern in context.
```

### Natural Bridges to Missing Information

Chitta finds natural moments to fill gaps:

```
To get birth history (naturally):
"דניאל בן 3.5... איך היה כשהוא היה תינוק?
ההריון והלידה עברו בסדר?"

To get siblings:
"יש לדניאל אחים?"

To get previous evaluations:
"האם מישהו אי פעם העריך את דניאל?
רופא, גננת, מומחה כלשהו?"

To get strengths when stuck on concerns:
"בתוך כל מה שסיפרת - מה כן עובד?
מתי דניאל הכי הוא עצמו?"
```

## Part 12: Returning Sessions

### What Chitta Knows

When parent returns, Chitta has full context:

```
RETURNING SESSION CONTEXT

TIME GAP
├── Hours (same day) → Continue naturally
├── Days → Reconnect, check in
└── Weeks → Warmer reconnection, recap

WHAT HAPPENED SINCE
├── Artifacts completed?
├── Videos uploaded?
├── Anything pending?
└── Last conversation topic?

GESTALT STATE
├── What do we know?
├── What's missing?
├── Active hypotheses?
└── Patterns detected?

LAST INTERACTION
├── How did we part?
├── Any action items?
├── Emotional state?
└── Open threads?
```

### Opening Based on Context

```
RETURNING AFTER DAYS - Nothing pending

Chitta: "היי, מה נשמע? איך דניאל?"
        "Hey, how's it going? How's Daniel?"

Simple, warm, open. Let parent lead.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RETURNING AFTER DAYS - Videos pending

Chitta: "היי! איך הולך?
        הספקת לצלם משהו, או שהחיים היו עמוסים?"

        "Hey! How's it going?
        Did you manage to film anything, or has life been busy?"

Acknowledges pending task without pressure.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RETURNING AFTER DAYS - Analysis ready (not yet seen)

Chitta: "היי! מאז שדיברנו, הספקתי לנתח את הסרטון ששלחת.
        יש כמה דברים מעניינים. רוצה לשמוע?"

        "Hey! Since we talked, I analyzed the video you sent.
        There are some interesting things. Want to hear?"

Leads with what's new and relevant.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RETURNING AFTER WEEKS

Chitta: "שמחה לראות אותך! עבר קצת זמן.
        איך דניאל? איך את?"

        "Good to see you! It's been a while.
        How's Daniel? How are you?"

Warmer, acknowledges gap, checks in on both.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

RETURNING - Last session was emotional

Chitta: "היי. הפעם הקודמת הייתה קשה.
        איך את מרגישה?"

        "Hey. Last time was hard.
        How are you feeling?"

Acknowledges, doesn't pretend it didn't happen.
```

### Thread Memory

Chitta remembers open threads and can pick them up:

```
OPEN THREADS

thread_1:
  topic: "Transitions difficulty"
  status: exploring
  last_discussed: 3 days ago
  hypothesis: "Sensory + need for predictability"

thread_2:
  topic: "Grandmother relationship"
  status: curious
  last_discussed: 1 week ago
  observation: "He's different with her - more spontaneous"
  question: "What makes it different?"
```

When relevant:

```
Parent: "Things are pretty much the same"

Chitta: "בסדר. בפעם שעברה דיברנו על זה שעם סבתא הוא
        יותר ספונטני. עדיין ככה? חשבתי על זה..."

        "Okay. Last time we talked about how he's more
        spontaneous with grandma. Still that way?
        I've been thinking about it..."
```

The app is asynchronous. Artifacts generate while conversation continues. Videos are uploaded hours or days later. Analysis happens in background.

### Artifact States

```
VIDEO OBSERVATION FLOW

1. GUIDELINES_READY (waiting for videos)
   └── Parent has guidelines
   └── 0 of N videos uploaded
   └── Conversation can continue

2. VIDEOS_PARTIAL
   └── Some videos uploaded
   └── 2 of 3 videos received

3. VIDEOS_COMPLETE
   └── All requested videos received
   └── Ready for analysis

4. ANALYSIS_IN_PROGRESS
   └── Analyzing videos

5. ANALYSIS_READY
   └── Analysis complete
   └── Ready to discuss
```

### UI Handles Notifications

Cards appear based on state. Conversation continues independently.

```

### Chitta Doesn't Force Topic Changes

When artifact completes mid-conversation:

```
Parent: "...and yesterday at the park he actually—"

        [Card appears: Video analysis ready]

Parent: (continues or clicks card)

If continues:
Chitta: "—he actually what? Tell me about the park!"

If clicks card:
→ Space opens with analysis
→ Context shifts to discussing findings
```

Chitta acknowledges what's ready but doesn't interrupt important moments.

### When to Mention Artifacts

```
HIGH - Always mention at natural moment:
├── First video analysis complete
├── Parent report ready
└── Something that changes understanding

MEDIUM - Mention if relevant or at session start:
├── Additional video analyses
├── Videos still needed (gentle reminder)

LOW - Card is enough, don't mention:
├── Internal artifacts
├── Minor updates
└── Things already discussed
```

### Natural Weaving

At natural pauses, Chitta can mention:

```
Parent: "...so yeah, that's what happened at the park."

Chitta: "That's really meaningful - him glancing at the other
        kid, staying nearby. That's social interest emerging.

        Oh, and I finished looking at the mealtime video you
        sent. Want to hear what I noticed? Or should we keep
        talking about the park moment?"
```

Offers, doesn't force. Parent chooses.

## Part 14: Live Document Feature

### Documents Are Interactive

Artifacts aren't just output—they're conversation pieces. The Live Document feature lets parents ask questions about specific sections.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                  │
│   VIDEO GUIDELINES FOR DANIEL                                   │
│                                                                  │

│   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│   │ 💬 Ask about this section:                              │   │
│   │ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │   │
│   │ │ "Why mealtime? He eats fine."                       │ │   │
│   │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │   │
│   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Context Comes With Question

When parent asks from within document, Chitta receives:

```
USER QUESTION (from Live Document)

Source: baseline_video_guidelines
Section: Scenario 1 - Mealtime
Section Content: "Film Daniel during a meal..."

Question: "Why mealtime? He eats fine."
```

Chitta knows exactly what they're asking about. No guessing needed.

### Parent Reactions Reveal Information

The document becomes a conversation piece:

```
Document: "Film during mealtime"
Parent: "But he eats fine, it's only speech I'm worried about"

Chitta learns: Food is NOT a concern (updates Gestalt)

Chitta: "Good to know meals are smooth! That's actually
        useful information. Let me think about whether
        we still need that video or if there's something
        more useful to observe..."
```

## Part 15: Tools Emerge from Conversation

### Not Forced, Natural

Tools aren't triggered by thresholds. They arise from the conversation naturally:

```
TOOL TRIGGERS

update_child_understanding
├── Trigger: Parent shares ANY information about child
└── Continuous throughout conversation

capture_story
├── Trigger: Parent shares specific moment with meaning
├── Signal: Narrative structure, emotional weight
└── "Something happened yesterday..."

form_hypothesis
├── Trigger: Pattern crystallizes into working theory
├── Signal: Multiple observations connect
└── "I'm noticing that X, Y, and Z all point to..."

generate_video_guidelines
├── Trigger:
│   ├── Have hypotheses worth exploring through observation
│   ├── Parent seems ready (not overwhelmed)
│   └── Natural moment in conversation
└── "I'd love to see Daniel in action..."

answer_developmental_question
├── Trigger: Parent asks about development
└── "Is this normal for his age?"
```

### Video Guidelines = Asking for Video

Asking for video means giving guidelines. They're the same activity. The guidelines artifact exists because:
- Parent needs reference for what to film
- App is asynchronous—parent films later
- Guidelines should be easily accessible in the Space

When Chitta says "I'd love to see Daniel during meals," that generates guidelines the parent can access anytime.
