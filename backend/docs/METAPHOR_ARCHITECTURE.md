# Chitta Metaphor Architecture

A guide to the naming philosophy and metaphorical coherence of Chitta.

---

## Core Philosophy

Names should **grasp essence** and **resonate with the whole**.

A name is not a label — it's a window into what something truly is. Every name in Chitta should:
1. Reflect the essence of what it names
2. Cohere with the broader metaphorical landscape
3. Come from a unified tradition where possible
4. Be poetic, not mechanical

## The Complete Metaphor Map

| Concept | Name | Origin | Meaning |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| The App | **Chitta** | Sanskrit | Consciousness, awareness, mind-stuff |
| The Observer | **Darshan** | Sanskrit | Mutual seeing — to see and be seen |
| Phase 1 | **Perception** | English | Receiving what is shared |
| Phase 2 | **Response** | English | Being present with |
| The Tools | **notice, wonder, capture_story** | English | Acts of seeing and receiving |
| The Curiosities | **Curiosities** | English | What draws the gaze |
| Curiosity strength | **pull** | English | How strongly it draws attention |
| The Investigation | **Exploration** | English | Following a thread of curiosity |
| What we know | **observations** | English | What has been seen (from words or video) |
| The Understanding | **Crystal** | English | Emergent clarity, forms naturally |
| Missing pieces | **ClinicalGaps** | English | What hasn't been seen yet |
| For Parents | **Portrait** | English | The living picture in ChildSpace |
| For Anyone | **Letter** | English | Personal sharing — grandmother, teacher, doctor |

## The Sanskrit Thread

**Chitta** and **Darshan** come from the same tradition — Sanskrit, rooted in Hindu/Buddhist philosophy.

### Chitta (चित्त)
- Means: consciousness, awareness, mind-stuff
- Not "brain" (analytical) or "psyche" (emotional)
- The witnessing awareness itself
- What the app IS — aware, present, noticing

### Darshan (दर्शन)
- Means: seeing AND being seen
- The sacred mutual gaze
- When you have darshan of a deity, you see them AND they see you
- Bidirectional: witnessing (seeing) + presence (being seen/held)
- What the observer DOES — sees the child, holds them in its gaze

---

## Why Darshan (Not Gestalt)

**Gestalt** was correct in meaning (holistic, emergent whole) but came from a different metaphorical universe (German psychology).

**Darshan** captures the same holistic quality while:
1. Coming from the same tradition as Chitta
2. Emphasizing the relational quality (seeing/being seen)
3. Capturing both witnessing AND presence in one word
4. Being warm, sacred, poetic

### The Breathing Analogy

The observer does TWO things:
- **Witnesses** (sees, perceives, receives) — like inhaling
- **Is Present** (holds, responds, is with) — like exhaling

These are not two separate things but two movements of ONE activity — like breathing.

**Darshan** captures this because seeing and being seen are simultaneous, not sequential. The gaze holds both.

## All Renames

| Before | After | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `LivingGestalt` | `Darshan` | Mutual seeing, same tradition as Chitta |
| Phase 1: `Extraction` | Phase 1: `Perception` | Darshan perceives, doesn't extract |
| `ExplorationCycle` | `Exploration` | No mechanical "cycle" — following a thread |
| `CuriosityEngine` | `Curiosities` | No "engine" — living curiosities |
| `activation` | `pull` | Curiosity pulls attention, not pushed |
| `facts` | `observations` | What has been seen, not cold facts |
| `ClinicalGapDetector` | `ClinicalGaps` | No "detector" — awareness of gaps |
| Professional Summary | `Letter` | Personal, warm — for anyone |

---

## Portrait vs Letter

| Artifact | Audience | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Portrait** | Parents | The living understanding shown in ChildSpace |
| **Letter** | Anyone | Personal sharing — grandmother, teacher, pediatrician, parents |

Both are acts of sharing what Darshan has seen:
- **Portrait** = for the family, in the app
- **Letter** = for others, to be shared

---

## Observations (Keeping It Simple)

All observations are **observations** — whether from:
- Parent's words (what they told us)
- Video (what we saw directly)

The source is noted in metadata, not in the name. Both contribute to understanding.

---

## The Naming Principles

### Soul Language (Use)
- `notice` — gentle attention
- `wonder` — to ask and marvel
- `capture_story` — receiving treasures
- `perceive` — seeing what is shared
- `pull` — what draws the gaze
- `observations` — what has been seen
- `exploration` — following a thread
- `crystal` — emergent clarity
- `portrait` — the living picture
- `letter` — personal sharing

### Mechanical Language (Avoid)
- `extract` — mining
- `detect` — problem-seeking
- `assess` — measuring against standard
- `diagnose` — labeling
- `process` — computational
- `engine` — industrial
- `cycle` — repetitive, mechanical
- `activation` — neuroscience jargon
- `facts` — cold, clinical

## The Coherence Test

Ask of each name: **"Would a contemplative, aware observer use this word?"**

| Name | Passes? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Chitta | Yes | It IS awareness |
| Darshan | Yes | It IS seeing |
| Perception | Yes | Receiving |
| Wonder | Yes | Pure |
| Notice | Yes | Gentle attention |
| Pull | Yes | Natural force |
| Observations | Yes | What was seen |
| Exploration | Yes | Following curiosity |
| Crystal | Yes | Emergent clarity |
| Portrait | Yes | Living picture |
| Letter | Yes | Personal sharing |
| ClinicalGaps | Yes | What hasn't been seen |
| ~~Extraction~~ | No | Mechanical, mining |
| ~~Engine~~ | No | Industrial |
| ~~Cycle~~ | No | Mechanical |
| ~~Activation~~ | No | Jargon |
| ~~Detector~~ | No | Problem-seeking |

## In Prose

> **Chitta** is awareness — the consciousness that holds.
>
> **Darshan** is how that awareness sees — the mutual gaze where the child is witnessed and held.
>
> Through **wonder**, curiosity arises. Through **noticing**, observations accumulate.
>
> **Curiosities** pull the gaze toward what wants to be understood. **Explorations** follow threads of inquiry.
>
> Over time, understanding **crystallizes** — patterns emerge, essence clarifies.
>
> When **ClinicalGaps** are noticed, they guide gentle questions — not interrogation.
>
> The **Portrait** shows parents the living picture of their child.
>
> A **Letter** shares that understanding with anyone who needs it — grandmother, teacher, or doctor.

## Code Naming Guide

### Classes
```python
class Darshan:           # The observer (was LivingGestalt)
class Curiosity:         # A single curiosity
class Exploration:       # Following a thread (was ExplorationCycle)
class Crystal:           # Crystallized understanding
class ClinicalGaps:      # Awareness of missing pieces (was ClinicalGapDetector)
```

### Properties
```python
curiosity.pull              # How strongly it draws (was activation)
understanding.observations  # What has been seen (was facts)
```

### Methods
```python
async def perceive()     # Phase 1 (was extract)
async def respond()      # Phase 2
def notice()             # Tool: gentle seeing
def wonder()             # Tool: asking and marveling
def capture_story()      # Tool: receiving treasures
```

### Artifacts
```python
portrait    # The living picture for parents
letter      # Personal sharing for anyone
```

### Avoid
```python
# Don't use:
class CuriosityEngine        # Engine is mechanical
class ExplorationCycle       # Cycle is mechanical
def extract()                # Extract is mining
def detect_gaps()            # Detect is problem-seeking
curiosity.activation         # Activation is jargon
understanding.facts          # Facts is cold
```

## Other Candidates Considered

During our exploration, we considered:

| Name | Tradition | Why Not Chosen |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Sakshi** | Sanskrit (witness) | Too obscure, requires explanation |
| **Presence** | English | Captures holding, less precise on seeing |
| **Witness** | English | Captures seeing, but colder, less relational |
| **Spanda** | Sanskrit (pulsation) | Describes mechanism, not identity |
| **Attunement** | Psychology | Not poetic, doesn't flow |
| **Avatar** | Sanskrit (descent) | About incarnation, not mutual seeing |
| **Grace** | English | Beautiful but doesn't capture the seeing |
| **Beholder** | English | Too literal, not poetic enough |

**Darshan** was chosen because it:
1. Captures both witnessing AND presence
2. Is from the same tradition as Chitta
3. Is relational — seeing AND being seen
4. Is poetic and mystical
5. Directly maps to "observing intelligence"

---

## The Heart of It

When a parent uses Chitta, what do they experience?

**Their child is finally seen.**

Truly seen. Not assessed. Not diagnosed. Not measured.

*Seen.*

That is Darshan.
