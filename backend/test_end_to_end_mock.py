End-to-End Integration Test (Mock Version) - Tests integration logic without LLM calls

Tests the complete Wu Wei architecture integration:
- Schema registry (completeness calculation)
- Action registry (prerequisite checking)
- Phase manager (phase transitions)
- Service integration

This version uses mocked data to test the integration logic.
